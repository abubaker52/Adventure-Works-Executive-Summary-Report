This pattern repeats every four months starting from January 2023.

Recommendations for Decision Makers

    Inventory Management: Focus on maintaining adequate stock levels of Mountain Bikes, as they have the highest order totals. Conversely, consider evaluating the inventory levels for Kids Bikes due to their lower demand.

    Customer Engagement: Implement targeted marketing strategies in Long Beach to increase average order totals, given it has the lowest average order total among customer cities.

    Product Development: Explore opportunities to expand the BMX Bikes category, given their high average order quantity, and optimize the product line for Downhill bikes due to their higher product weight.

    Operational Efficiency: Investigate the factors contributing to the high number of orders on specific dates, such as 20 March 2023, to replicate these conditions and boost sales on other days.

    Forecast Adjustment: Given the irregular patterns in order forecasting, consider more sophisticated predictive models or machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting.

    Sales Strategy: Regularly review sales data and adjust sales strategies quarterly to adapt to the repeating four-month pattern observed in order totals.

By implementing these recommendations, Adventure Works can enhance its operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its product offerings to drive growth and profitability.
